# deploy-and-validate-calibnet.sh - Deploy and validate FilecoinWarmStorageService contracts on Calibnet
#
# This script combines deployment and validation into a single operation:
# 1. Runs the existing deployment script
# 2. Parses deployment output to extract contract addresses
# 3. Runs comprehensive validation of deployed contracts
#
# Usage: ./deploy-and-validate-calibnet.sh
#
# Required Environment Variables (same as deploy-all-warm-storage-calibnet.sh):
# - KEYSTORE: Path to the Ethereum keystore file
# - PASSWORD: Password for the keystore
# - RPC_URL: RPC endpoint for Calibration testnet
# - CHALLENGE_FINALITY: Challenge finality parameter for PDPVerifier
#
# Optional Environment Variables:
# - MAX_PROVING_PERIOD: Maximum epochs between proofs (default: 30)
# - CHALLENGE_WINDOW_SIZE: Challenge window size in epochs (default: 15)
# - FILCDN_WALLET: FileCDN wallet address (has default)
